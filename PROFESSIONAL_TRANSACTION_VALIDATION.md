      return (
        <span className="px-2 py-1 bg-red-100 text-red-700 text-xs font-medium rounded-full">
          Cancelled ✗
        </span>
      );
    }
    if (transaction.edit_reason) {
      return (
        <span className="px-2 py-1 bg-orange-100 text-orange-700 text-xs font-medium rounded-full">
          Modified ✏️
        </span>
      );
    }
    if (transaction.status === "pending") {
      return (
        <span className="px-2 py-1 bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700 text-xs font-medium rounded-full">
          Pending ⏳
        </span>
      );
    }
    return (
      <span className="px-2 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-700 text-xs font-medium rounded-full">
        Completed ✓
      </span>
    );
  })();
}
```

### Enhanced Button Styling:

```jsx
// Edit Button - Status-aware
className={`p-2 rounded-lg transition-all ${
  transaction.edit_reason
    ? "text-orange-600 bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 hover:bg-orange-100"
    : "text-gray-400 hover:text-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-50"
}`}

// Undo Button - Disabled state handling
className={`p-2 rounded-lg transition-all ${
  transaction.status === "cancelled"
    ? "text-gray-300 bg-gray-100 cursor-not-allowed"
    : "text-gray-400 hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50"
}`}
```

### Professional Notifications:

```jsx
alert(
  `✅ Transaction Modified Successfully!\n\n` +
    `Original Amount: ₱${oldAmount.toFixed(2)}\n` +
    `New Amount: ₱${newAmount.toFixed(2)}\n` +
