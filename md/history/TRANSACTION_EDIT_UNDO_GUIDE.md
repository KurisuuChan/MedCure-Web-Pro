# 🔧 Transaction Edit/Undo System - Technical Documentation

## 📋 System Overview

The Transaction Edit/Undo system provides comprehensive transaction modification capabilities with proper stock management, revenue calculation accuracy, and complete audit trail compliance.

## 🎯 **Core Functionality**

### **Edit Transaction Feature**

- **Time Window**: 24-hour modification period from transaction completion
- **Stock Management**: Automatic stock restoration and reallocation
- **Revenue Impact**: Real-time revenue recalculation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all modifications with user tracking

### **Undo Transaction Feature**

- **Complete Reversal**: Full transaction cancellation with stock restoration
- **Status Management**: Changes transaction status from 'completed' to 'cancelled'
- **Revenue Exclusion**: Cancelled transactions excluded from revenue calculations
- **Permanent Record**: Transaction remains in database for audit purposes

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Functions**

#### **Edit Transaction Function**

```sql
-- Function: edit_transaction_with_stock_management
-- Purpose: Modify existing transaction with proper stock handling
-- Status: Transaction remains 'completed' after edit
-- Revenue Impact: Updated amounts included in revenue calculations
```

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Validates 24-hour edit window
- ✅ Restores original stock quantities
- ✅ Deducts new stock quantities
- ✅ Updates revenue calculations
- ✅ Logs edit reason and user information

#### **Undo Transaction Function**

```sql
-- Function: undo_transaction_completely
-- Purpose: Cancel transaction and restore all stock
-- Status: Sets transaction status to 'cancelled'
-- Revenue Impact: Excluded from all revenue calculations
```

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Sets status = 'cancelled'
- ✅ Restores all stock quantities
- ✅ Excludes from revenue calculations
- ✅ Maintains audit trail
- ✅ Permanent transaction record

### **Frontend Integration**

#### **Transaction Service**

```javascript
// File: src/services/unifiedTransactionService.js
// Handles edit/undo operations with proper error handling
```

**Key Methods:**

- `editTransaction()`: Modify existing transaction
- `undoTransaction()`: Cancel and restore stock
- `validateEditWindow()`: Check 24-hour limit
- `updateRevenue()`: Recalculate totals

#### **Revenue Analytics**

```javascript
// Files: analyticsService.js, reportingService.js, dataService.js
// All revenue functions filter by status = 'completed'
```

**Critical Filter:**

```sql
WHERE s.status = 'completed'  -- Excludes cancelled transactions
```

## 🔍 **Revenue Calculation Logic**

### **Accurate Revenue Tracking**

The system ensures accurate revenue calculations by:

1. **Including Completed Transactions**

   - Original completed transactions: `status = 'completed'`
   - Edited transactions: `status = 'completed'` (with updated amounts)

2. **Excluding Cancelled Transactions**

   - Undone transactions: `status = 'cancelled'`
   - Failed transactions: `status = 'cancelled'`

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Edit operation: Revenue updated with new amounts
   - Undo operation: Revenue excludes cancelled transaction

### **Database Revenue Functions**

```sql
-- Daily Revenue (Excludes Cancelled)
SELECT SUM(total_amount)
FROM sales
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Monthly Revenue (Excludes Cancelled)
SELECT SUM(total_amount)
FROM sales
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE);
```

## 📊 **Stock Management Integration**

### **Edit Transaction Stock Flow**

```
1. User initiates edit
2. System validates 24-hour window
3. Original stock quantities restored to inventory
4. New quantities deducted from inventory
5. Transaction updated with new amounts
6. Revenue calculations updated
7. Audit log created
```

### **Undo Transaction Stock Flow**

```
1. User initiates undo
2. All stock quantities restored to inventory
3. Transaction status set to 'cancelled'
4. Revenue calculations exclude transaction
5. Audit log created
6. Transaction preserved for compliance
```

## 🔒 **Security & Validation**

### **Edit Window Enforcement**

```sql
-- 24-hour validation
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
```

### **Stock Validation**

- Prevents negative stock scenarios
- Validates batch inventory availability
- Ensures FIFO compliance
- Real-time stock checks

### **User Authentication**

- Logged-in user requirement
- Audit trail with user ID
- Edit reason mandatory
- Permission-based access

## 🎯 **Business Rules**

### **Edit Transaction Rules**

1. ✅ 24-hour window from completion
2. ✅ Must provide edit reason
3. ✅ Stock availability validation
4. ✅ User authentication required
5. ✅ Audit trail logging

### **Undo Transaction Rules**

1. ✅ No time limit (can undo anytime)
2. ✅ Complete stock restoration
3. ✅ Status change to 'cancelled'
4. ✅ Revenue exclusion
5. ✅ Permanent audit record

## 📈 **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimized Operations**

- **Batch Updates**: Multiple items updated in single transaction
- **Index Usage**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Real-time Sync**: Efficient stock updates across clients
- **Minimal Locks**: Non-blocking operations where possible

### **Error Handling**

- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic reversal on failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating during errors
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and guidance
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automatic system recovery

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues**

**1. Edit Window Expired**

- **Cause**: Transaction older than 24 hours
- **Solution**: Use undo feature instead of edit
- **Prevention**: Process edits promptly

**2. Stock Insufficient**

- **Cause**: Not enough inventory for new quantities
- **Solution**: Adjust quantities or manage stock
- **Prevention**: Real-time stock validation

**3. Revenue Discrepancy**

- **Cause**: Cancelled transactions included in calculations
- **Solution**: Verify status filtering in revenue functions
- **Prevention**: Ensure proper status = 'completed' filtering

### **Validation Checks**

```sql
-- Verify cancelled transactions excluded
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM sales
WHERE status = 'cancelled'
  AND id IN (SELECT sale_id FROM revenue_calculations);
-- Should return 0

-- Verify edit audit trail
SELECT *
FROM sale_edit_history
WHERE sale_id = [transaction_id]
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
