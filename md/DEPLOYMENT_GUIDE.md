# ðŸš€ MedCure-Pro Deployment Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Start Deployment

### **1. Database Setup**

Execute the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Single file deployment: FINAL_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA.sql
-- Contains all tables, functions, indexes, and security policies
```

**File Location**: `database/FINAL_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA.sql`

This comprehensive script includes:

- âœ… All core tables (products, sales, stock_movements, batch_inventory)
- âœ… Business logic functions (transaction processing, revenue analytics)
- âœ… Performance indexes for optimal query speed
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- âœ… Real-time subscriptions setup

### **2. Environment Configuration**

Create `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### **3. Frontend Deployment**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build (optional)
npm run preview

# Deploy to your hosting service
# (Vercel, Netlify, or custom server)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Production Checklist**

### **Database Validation**

- [ ] Execute `FINAL_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA.sql` successfully
- [ ] Verify all tables created with proper columns
- [ ] Test core functions (create_sale_with_items, complete_transaction_with_stock)
- [ ] Confirm RLS policies are active
- [ ] Validate real-time subscriptions

### **Environment Setup**

- [ ] Supabase URL configured correctly
- [ ] API keys working and authenticated
- [ ] Environment variables secure (not exposed in client)
- [ ] CORS settings configured for your domain

### **Security Configuration**

- [ ] Row Level Security enabled on all tables
- [ ] User authentication flow tested
- [ ] API endpoints protected
- [ ] Input validation working

### **Performance Validation**

- [ ] Database indexes applied
- [ ] Query performance acceptable (<100ms for common operations)
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning
- [ ] Memory usage optimized

## ðŸ”§ **System Features Verification**

### **Core POS Functions**

```bash
âœ… Product search and selection
âœ… Cart management and checkout
âœ… PWD/Senior discount application
âœ… Real-time stock deduction
âœ… Transaction completion workflow
```

### **Transaction Management**

```bash
âœ… Edit transactions (24-hour window)
âœ… Undo transactions with stock restoration
âœ… Revenue calculation accuracy
âœ… Audit trail logging
âœ… Status management (pending â†’ completed â†’ cancelled)
```

### **Analytics & Reporting**

```bash
âœ… Daily revenue reports
âœ… Stock movement tracking
âœ… Low stock alerts
âœ… Performance metrics dashboard
âœ… Historical data analysis
```

## ðŸŽª **Critical Business Logic**

### **Revenue Calculation**

The system properly excludes cancelled transactions from revenue:

```sql
-- Revenue functions filter by status = 'completed'
WHERE s.status = 'completed'  -- Excludes cancelled transactions
```

### **Stock Management**

- **FIFO**: First-in-First-out batch processing
- **Multi-unit**: Automatic conversion between pieces, sheets, boxes
- **Real-time**: Live stock updates across all clients
- **Validation**: Prevents overselling with stock checks

### **Transaction Integrity**

- **Two-phase commit**: Create transaction â†’ Complete transaction
- **Rollback capability**: Automatic reversal on errors
- **Audit compliance**: Full transaction history with user tracking
- **Edit window**: 24-hour modification period for corrections

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**1. Revenue Not Updating**

- Verify cancelled transactions are excluded from calculations
- Check database functions are filtering by `status = 'completed'`
- Ensure real-time subscriptions are active

**2. Stock Deduction Problems**

- Confirm `complete_transaction_with_stock` function is working
- Verify batch inventory updates
- Check for negative stock scenarios

**3. Transaction Edit/Undo Issues**

- Validate 24-hour edit window enforcement
- Ensure proper stock restoration on undo
- Check audit trail logging

### **Database Health Check**

```sql
-- Verify system health
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_sales,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as revenue,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 END) as cancelled_count
FROM sales
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

## ðŸ“Š **Performance Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

- **Query Performance**: <100ms for standard operations
- **Revenue Accuracy**: Daily reconciliation required
- **Stock Sync**: Real-time updates across clients
- **Error Rate**: <1% transaction failure rate
- **User Experience**: <2 second page load times

### **Regular Maintenance**

- Daily revenue reconciliation
- Weekly stock audit
- Monthly performance review
- Quarterly security assessment
