   âœ… Senior discount (20%) with overpayment
   âœ… Custom discount with various amounts
   âœ… Large payment amounts (boundary testing)
   âœ… Multiple items with mixed unit types
   âœ… Change calculation accuracy

2. TRANSACTION HISTORY TESTS
   âœ… Transaction list display
   âœ… Transaction details view
   âœ… Transaction editing functionality
   âœ… User relationship embedding (cashier names)
   âœ… Date filtering and pagination
   âœ… Real-time updates after new sales

3. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT TESTS
   âœ… Stock level updates after sales
   âœ… Batch allocation (FIFO)
   âœ… Expiry tracking and alerts
   âœ… Low stock notifications
   âœ… Product availability checks
   âœ… Inventory movements logging

4. BATCH MANAGEMENT TESTS
   âœ… Batch creation and tracking
   âœ… FIFO allocation during sales
   âœ… Expiry date monitoring
   âœ… Batch disposal workflow
   âœ… Regulatory compliance features
   âœ… Batch movement audit trail

5. DATABASE INTEGRATION TESTS
   âœ… Trigger function execution
   âœ… Stored procedure performance
   âœ… Foreign key relationships
   âœ… RLS policy enforcement
   âœ… Data consistency across tables
   âœ… Concurrent transaction handling

6. USER INTERFACE TESTS
   âœ… Modal functionality
   âœ… Form validation
   âœ… Loading states
   âœ… Error message display
   âœ… Navigation flow
   âœ… Responsive design

IDENTIFIED ISSUES TO RESOLVE:
ðŸ”§ Transaction editor modal not working (props mismatch)
ðŸ”§ Undo functionality needs implementation
ðŸ”§ Real-time notifications system integration
ðŸ”§ Performance optimization for large datasets
ðŸ”§ Enhanced error handling for edge cases

NEXT STEPS:

1. Fix transaction editor functionality
2. Implement comprehensive undo system
3. Add real-time notification integration
4. Performance optimization and stress testing
5. Final user acceptance testing
