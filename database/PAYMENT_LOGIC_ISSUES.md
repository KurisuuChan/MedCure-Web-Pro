CRITICAL PAYMENT LOGIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. ‚ùå WRONG TOTAL BEING SAVED TO DATABASE
   Location: usePOS.js line 158
   Issue: total: paymentData.amount (saves amount paid, not sale total)
   Fix: Should save actual sale total after discount

2. ‚ùå INSUFFICIENT PAYMENT VALIDATION IS INCORRECT  
   Location: usePOS.js line 145-147
   Issue: Validates against cart total before discount
   Fix: Should validate against final total after discount

3. ‚ùå AMOUNT INPUT ACCEPTS ANY LARGE VALUE
   Location: POSPage.jsx payment input
   Issue: No maximum validation, accepts unreasonable amounts
   Fix: Add reasonable maximum limits

4. ‚ùå CHANGE CALCULATION MAY BE WRONG
   Location: usePOS.js line 182 (transaction enhancement)
   Issue: change: paymentData.amount - total (uses pre-discount total)
   Fix: Should use post-discount total

5. ‚ùå DATABASE STORES WRONG VALUES
   Location: dataService.js line 347
   Issue: total_amount: saleData.total (which is actually amount paid)
   Fix: Should store the actual sale total

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

Current Flow:

1. Customer buys ‚Ç±100 worth of items
2. 20% discount applied = ‚Ç±80 final total
3. Customer pays ‚Ç±1000
4. System saves ‚Ç±1000 as the sale total (WRONG!)
5. Change calculated as ‚Ç±1000 - ‚Ç±100 = ‚Ç±900 (WRONG!)

Correct Flow Should Be:

1. Customer buys ‚Ç±100 worth of items
2. 20% discount applied = ‚Ç±80 final total
3. Customer pays ‚Ç±1000
4. System saves ‚Ç±80 as the sale total (CORRECT)
5. Change calculated as ‚Ç±1000 - ‚Ç±80 = ‚Ç±920 (CORRECT)

IMPACT:

- Financial reports show inflated sales figures
- Change calculations are incorrect
- Revenue tracking is completely wrong
- Tax calculations may be affected
- Inventory costing is misaligned
