/*
üéØ TRANSACTION EDITING ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED:

1. ‚ùå MISSING MODAL WRAPPER
   Issue: TransactionEditor wasn't wrapped in modal container
   Fix: Added proper modal backdrop and positioning in POSPage.jsx

2. ‚ùå WRONG PROP NAMES
   Issue: TransactionEditor expects 'onCancel' but POSPage passed 'onClose'
   Fix: Updated to use correct prop names

3. ‚ùå MISSING CURRENT USER
   Issue: TransactionEditor needs currentUser prop for audit trail
   Fix: Added currentUser={user} prop

4. ‚ùå INCOMPLETE SERVICE INTEGRATION
   Issue: handleTransactionUpdated wasn't calling the actual service
   Fix: Updated to call salesService.editTransaction() properly

TRANSACTION EDITING CAPABILITIES:
‚úÖ Edit quantities of items within 24 hours
‚úÖ Remove items from transactions
‚úÖ Adjust discounts (PWD/Senior)
‚úÖ Require edit reason for audit trail
‚úÖ Track who edited and when
‚úÖ Store original values for comparison

CURRENT UNDO/AUDIT SYSTEM:

üìã AUDIT TRAIL FEATURES:
‚úÖ Edit History: Every edit is tracked with:
   - Original total amount
   - New total amount  
   - Edit reason (required)
   - Who made the edit (edited_by)
   - When it was edited (edited_at)
   - Edit flag (is_edited = true)

‚úÖ Database Audit Logging:
   - audit_log table tracks all sensitive operations
   - Stores old_values and new_values as JSONB
   - Includes user_id, timestamp, and operation type
   - Auto-triggered on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

üîÑ UNDO CAPABILITIES:

CURRENT SYSTEM:
‚ùå No direct "undo" button in UI
‚úÖ BUT: Complete audit trail allows manual restoration:
   - original_total field stores pre-edit amount
   - old_values in audit_log stores complete previous state
   - Admins can manually revert using stored data

POSSIBLE UNDO IMPLEMENTATIONS:

1. üìö VIEW-ONLY UNDO (Current):
   - Transaction history shows all edits
   - Audit log provides complete change history
   - Manual restoration possible by admin

2. üîÑ SEMI-AUTOMATIC UNDO:
   - Add "Revert to Original" button
   - Uses original_total and audit data
   - Creates new edit entry with revert reason

3. üöÄ FULL UNDO SYSTEM:
   - Complete transaction versioning
   - One-click undo for recent edits
   - Undo history with multiple restore points

CURRENT AUDIT QUERIES:

-- View all transaction edits
SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.total_amount,
    s.original_total,
    s.edit_reason,
    s.edited_by,
    s.edited_at,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as editor_name
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN users u ON s.edited_by = u.id
WHERE s.is_edited = true
ORDER BY s.edited_at DESC;

-- View complete audit trail
SELECT 
    al.*,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as user_name
FROM audit_log al
LEFT JOIN users u ON al.user_id = u.id
WHERE al.table_name = 'sales'
ORDER BY al.timestamp DESC;

RECOMMENDATIONS:

üéØ FOR IMMEDIATE USE:
1. Current editing system works fully
2. Complete audit trail is available
3. Manual restoration possible via original_total field

üöÄ FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
1. Add "Revert to Original" button in TransactionEditor
2. Implement transaction version history view
3. Add one-click undo for recent changes (< 1 hour)

SECURITY FEATURES:
‚úÖ Time-limited editing (24 hours only)
‚úÖ Role-based access (only cashier/admin/manager)
‚úÖ Mandatory edit reasons
‚úÖ Complete audit trail
‚úÖ Original values preserved
‚úÖ User tracking for all changes
