FIXES APPLIED TO RESOLVE PAYMENT LOGIC ERRORS:

1. âœ… FIXED: Correct Total Being Saved to Database
   File: usePOS.js line 164
   Before: total: paymentData.amount (saved amount paid)
   After: total: finalTotalAfterDiscount (saves actual sale total)
   Impact: Database now stores correct sale amounts

2. âœ… FIXED: Payment Validation Uses Correct Amount
   File: usePOS.js line 145-149  
   Before: Validated against cart total before discount
   After: Validates against final total after discount
   Impact: Prevents insufficient payment errors

3. âœ… FIXED: Amount Input Validation
   File: POSPage.jsx line 430+
   Before: No maximum validation, accepted unlimited amounts
   After: Clamps to 10x required amount (reasonable maximum)
   Impact: Prevents unreasonable payment amounts

4. âœ… FIXED: Change Calculation
   File: usePOS.js line 183
   Before: change: paymentData.amount - total (pre-discount)
   After: change: paymentData.amount - finalTotalAfterDiscount
   Impact: Correct change calculations

5. âœ… FIXED: Payment Validation Function
   File: usePOS.js line 252
   Before: Checked against total before discount
   After: Checks against finalTotalAfterDiscount
   Impact: Proper payment validation

6. âœ… FIXED: Calculate Change Function
   File: usePOS.js line 231
   Before: calculateChange(amountPaid) - no discount support
   After: calculateChange(amountPaid, discountAmount) - with discount
   Impact: Accurate change calculations with discounts

VALIDATION SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: â‚±100 cart, 20% discount (â‚±20 off), customer pays â‚±100

- Before: Sale total saved as â‚±100, change = â‚±0 (WRONG)
- After: Sale total saved as â‚±80, change = â‚±20 (CORRECT)

Scenario 2: â‚±50 cart, no discount, customer pays â‚±1000000

- Before: Accepted unlimited amount
- After: Clamped to â‚±500 (10x the required amount)

Scenario 3: â‚±75 cart, 10% discount (â‚±7.50 off), customer pays â‚±60

- Before: May pass validation (against â‚±75)
- After: Properly rejects (need â‚±67.50)

IMPACT OF FIXES:
âœ… Financial reports now show accurate sales figures
âœ… Change calculations are mathematically correct  
âœ… Revenue tracking is accurate
âœ… Payment validation prevents errors
âœ… User experience improved with proper feedback
âœ… No more inflated sales data in database
