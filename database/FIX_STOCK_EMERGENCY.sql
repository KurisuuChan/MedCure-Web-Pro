-- Step 1: Analyze current stock situation
SELECT 'STOCK ANALYSIS REPORT' as report_type;

-- Check products with zero or low stock
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.name,
    p.generic_name,
    p.stock_in_pieces,

FROM products p 
WHERE p.stock_in_pieces <= 5

-- Check recent stock movements to understand what happened
SELECT

FROM stock_movements sm
JOIN products p ON sm.product_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON sm.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY sm.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Step 2: Emergency stock replenishment for testing
-- Add stock to products that have zero inventory

UPDATE products 
SET 
    stock_in_pieces = CASE 
        WHEN stock_in_pieces = 0 THEN 100  -- Give 100 pieces to zero-stock items
        WHEN stock_in_pieces < 10 THEN stock_in_pieces + 50  -- Add 50 to low-stock items

        ELSE stock_in_boxes
    END,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE stock_in_pieces < 10;

-- Step 3: Create stock movement records for the replenishment
INSERT INTO stock_movements (

    END,

FROM products p 
WHERE p.stock_in_pieces <= 100  -- Only for recently updated products
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users); -- Only if we have users

-- Step 4: Verify the fix
SELECT 'STOCK REPLENISHMENT COMPLETE' as status;

-- Show updated stock levels
SELECT

-- Step 5: Test data verification
