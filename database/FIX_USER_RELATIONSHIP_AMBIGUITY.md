-- üîß FIX MULTIPLE USER RELATIONSHIP AMBIGUITY
-- Resolves Supabase/PostgREST relationship conflicts

ISSUE DIAGNOSED:
‚ùå Error: "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'sales' and 'users'"

ROOT CAUSE:
The sales table has multiple foreign key relationships to the users table:

1. sales.user_id ‚Üí users.id (cashier who made the sale)
2. sales.edited_by ‚Üí users.id (user who edited the transaction)

When PostgREST encounters: users (first_name, last_name)
It doesn't know which relationship to use and throws an ambiguity error.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
‚úÖ Fixed by specifying the exact foreign key relationship using the ! syntax:
OLD: users (first_name, last_name)
NEW: users!user_id (first_name, last_name)

FILES FIXED:
‚úÖ dataService.js - getSalesByDateRange() method line 447
‚úÖ dataService.js - getSales() method line 386  
‚úÖ dataService.js - editTransaction() method line 574

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
The ! syntax tells PostgREST exactly which foreign key to use:

- users!user_id means "join via the user_id foreign key"
- This disambiguates between user_id and edited_by relationships
- Results in clean joins without ambiguity errors

VALIDATION:
After applying this fix:

1. Transaction history should load correctly
2. Sales queries should work without relationship errors
3. User information (cashier names) should display properly
4. No more PGRST201 errors in console

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- This is a common issue in complex database schemas
- Always specify foreign keys when multiple relationships exist
- The syntax users!foreign_key_name is the standard PostgREST approach
- This fix maintains all existing functionality while resolving ambiguity
