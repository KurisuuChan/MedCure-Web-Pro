-- üîß TRANSACTION EDITING & UNDO SYSTEM ANALYSIS
-- Comprehensive analysis of editing capabilities and fixes
-- =================================================

TRANSACTION EDITING SYSTEM STATUS:

‚úÖ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:

1. TransactionEditor component exists and is properly structured
2. Edit button is correctly implemented in POSPage
3. salesService.editTransaction method is available
4. Modal wrapper is properly set up
5. All props are correctly passed to TransactionEditor

‚ùå POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. Edit button might be disabled due to 24-hour limit
2. Transaction data structure mismatch
3. Missing error handling in UI
4. No visual feedback on click

üîç DIAGNOSTIC STEPS NEEDED:

1. Check if edit button is disabled (24-hour rule)
2. Verify transaction data structure
3. Test modal opening/closing
4. Check console for JavaScript errors
5. Verify user permissions

UNDO SYSTEM CAPABILITIES:

‚úÖ BUILT-IN UNDO FEATURES:

1. Transaction History: Complete audit trail of all transactions
2. Edit Tracking: is_edited flag, edited_at timestamp, edit_reason
3. Original Values: original_total field preserves initial values
4. Editor Tracking: edited_by field tracks who made changes
5. Time Limits: 24-hour editing window for transaction integrity

‚úÖ UNDO MECHANISMS:

1. Soft Undo: Edit transaction back to original values
2. Audit Trail: Full history of changes with reasons
3. Reversal Documentation: Can create reversal transactions
4. Admin Override: Admin users can edit beyond time limits
5. Backup Data: Original values preserved in database

‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED (POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS):

1. One-click undo button
2. Automatic undo suggestions
3. Bulk undo operations
4. Undo stack (multiple levels)
5. Real-time undo notifications

TRANSACTION EDITING WORKFLOW:

1. User clicks edit button on transaction (within 24 hours)
2. TransactionEditor modal opens
3. User can modify items, quantities, discounts
4. User must provide edit reason
5. Changes are validated and saved
6. Original data is preserved for audit
7. Transaction is marked as edited

UNDO WORKFLOW (CURRENT):

1. Open edited transaction in TransactionEditor
2. Manually restore original values
3. Provide reason: "Undo previous edit - reverting to original"
4. Save changes
5. Transaction audit trail shows undo action

TROUBLESHOOTING EDIT BUTTON:

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify transaction is less than 24 hours old
- Ensure user has edit permissions
- Check if modal state is properly managed
- Verify transaction data has required fields
